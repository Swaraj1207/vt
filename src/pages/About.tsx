              About the Artist
            </h1>
            <p className="font-inter text-lg text-muted-foreground mb-6 leading-relaxed">
              For over two decades, I've been capturing the world through paint and canvas, transforming 
              emotions and experiences into tangible works of art. Each brushstroke is a conversation 
              between intention and intuition.
            </p>
            <p className="font-inter text-lg text-muted-foreground mb-6 leading-relaxed">
              My journey began in a small studio apartment, where curiosity and passion collided. 
              Today, my work has been featured in galleries across the country, and I'm honored to 
              have pieces in private collections worldwide.
            </p>
            <p className="font-inter text-lg text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed">
              I believe art should evoke emotion and create connection. Whether it's the warmth of 
              a sunset or the depth of an abstract composition, my goal is to create pieces that 
              resonate with the soul.

            Why I Paint
          </h2>
          <p className="font-inter text-lg text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed mb-6">
            Art is my language for expressing what words cannot capture. Through color, form, and 
            texture, I seek to create visual poetry that speaks to the human experience.
          </p>
          <p className="font-inter text-lg text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed">
            Every painting is an explorationâ€”a journey into the unknown where inspiration meets 
            technique. I'm driven by the desire to create work that not only beautifies spaces 
            but also enriches lives and sparks meaningful connections.
